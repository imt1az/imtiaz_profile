            <p>Hi! My Name is <span class="orange-color">Imtiaz Ahmed Chowdhury</span> I have worked as a web
                developer for the past one years,
                since graduating with honors with a degree in Computer Science.
                During this time I have had the opportunity to gain experience in the field and the
                chance to explore my skills and creativity. As a result, I have realized that I truly
                enjoy this career because it allows for endless creativity. I am eager to continue growing
                professionally and hope to one day open my own Web Development
                firm. However, I think I still have a lot to learn before embarking on that adventure!

            <h2>Mission</h2>
            <p>A software developer who wants to advance their career can also focus on their work habits and technical
                skills. If they take on more management and leadership roles, they can make a goal concerning their
                team.

            <h2>Vision</h2>
            <p>Programming languages are codes that allow computers to understand the developer's commands. Various
                languages have different uses, and software developers can learn more computer languages to expand their
                programming capabilities.

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>By learning more programming languages, a software developer can have more opportunities to work on
                various projects, regardless of the project's purpose or language. Software developers can learn new
                programming languages through additional study, classes or practice.

            <p>A common goal is to earn a promotion. This goal may depend on the company where they work. Some companies
                award promotions based on merit or seniority. If a promotion arises, it can be a good goal that helps
                the developer advance their career. A promotion can mean more responsibility, more leadership
                opportunities and a higher salary. It can also mean a more impressive title, which may look appealing on
                a resume.

                <p>A coding project can be new software or a new section of code that improves the software developers'
                    understanding of their abilities. Completing a coding project can help a developer practice an
                    important skill, and it can build their repertoire of abilities, improving their resume. This can be
                    a goal that they address at work or as a side project. A completed coding project may even inspire
                    them to bring new solutions into their work.
